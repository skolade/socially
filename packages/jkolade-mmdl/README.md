Looks like some other people also wrapped MDL, why use this one?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because the ones I tried don't work. I'm trying to use MDL in some of my Meteor projects and there are issues that won't be fixed by just adding `material.js`.

What I've experienced so far:

* Can't export `componentHandler` with the official build since it's defined with the keyword `var`. To really ***use*** MDL, you need `componentHandler`.
* When using Iron:Router, template rendering happens ***after*** `document.load` event, so MDL upgrades nothing by itself.
* Even when not using Iron:Router, it's lucky that `document.load` works; when any MDL components get re-rendered by Blaze, they are screwed again. Because MDL won't automatically re-scan DOM for potential upgrades. Check out my [blaze demo](https://github.com/Zodiase/meteor-mdl/tree/master/demo/blaze) without using this package to see how bad it is.

Features
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Exports `componentHandler` globally (Client Only).
* Supports [Iron:Router](https://github.com/iron-meteor/iron-router).*

Install
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```Bash
$ meteor add zodiase:mdl
```

Change Log
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* v1.0.0-4
	* Updated `material.js` with another custom build, adding the ability to do `componentHandler.upgradeAllRegistered(rootNode)`. Check out [my MDL fork](https://github.com/Zodiase/material-design-lite) for details.
	* Added a namespace `MDl` while maintaining `componentHandler` available globally. You can also use `Mdl.componentHandler` if it looks better.
	* `MDl.envConfig` stores runtime status generated by the package and public APIs for extensive features (to be added).
* v1.0.0-3
	* Slightly improved blaze patcher.
* v1.0.0-2
	* Fixed a bug causing build to fail. 
* v1.0.0-1
    * Started using `MutationObserver` to detect changes in DOM and then call MDL's `componentHandler.upgradeAllRegistered()`.
    * If `MutationObserver` is not available, falls back to the old (buggy) approach.
